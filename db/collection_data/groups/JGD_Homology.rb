Linear algebra for combinatorics

Abstract: Computations in algebraic combinatorics often boils down to
sparse linear algebra over some exact field. Such computations are
usually done in high level computer algebra systems like MuPAD or
Maple, which are reasonnably efficient when the ground field requires
symbolic computations.  However, when the ground field is, say Q or
Z/pZ, the use of external specialized libraries becomes necessary. This
document, geared toward developpers of such libraries, present a brief
overview of my needs, which seems to be fairly typical in the
community.
