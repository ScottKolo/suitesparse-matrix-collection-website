DBLP is a bibliography service from which an undirected scientific       
collaboration network can be extracted: each vertex represents a         
scientist and two vertices are connected if they have worked together    
on an article. This symmetric graph has been obtained in June 2010       
from the standard DBLP download (http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/).
